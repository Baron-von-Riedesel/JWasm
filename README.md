# JWasm
masm compatible assembler.

Runs under Windows, Linux, DOS ( and probably other OSes as well ).

Some Hints:
For Windows, use file MSVC.mak if Visual C is to be used to create JWasm.
For Linux, rename GccUnix.mak to Makefile, then run make to produce JWasm with gcc.
For DOS, you will probably need the HX development files to create a JWasm version
with Open Watcom or Visual C.

There is a bunch of other makefiles in the main directory, intended for other compilers. Some of them might be a bit outdated.
